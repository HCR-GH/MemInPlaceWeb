# MemoriesInPlace
 
 This repository contains materials to power a website for the Memories in Place project.
 
The site contains oral history recordings collected by Remembering the Past and which can be accessed through this website - the idea being that users can scan a QR code in a public place and hear a memory connected to that place.
 
The site also lets people record their own memory using the [MediaRecorder API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder) and uploads the recording to Google Drive and the associated information to Google Sheets - both done using Google's APIs.

Memories in Place is being created as part of my PhD research at Newcastle University in collaboration with [Remembering the Past](https://www.rememberingthepast.co.uk/)
